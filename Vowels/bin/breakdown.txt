What do we know about the words?

1. Each word has a "word" and a suffix at it's end
2. We manipulate the word and suffix individually
3. We want to print both the PLURAL and the SUFFIX for each word

RULES

Plurals:
1. If the word ends in a single consonant - Add "GH"
2. If the word ends in a single vowel - Drop the final vowel, add 'G'
3. If the words ends in 2 or more consonants OR vowels - Double the last letter, add 'H'

Suffixes that begin with consonants:
1. If the suffix ends in a single consonant - Add the suffix (no manipulation)
2. If the suffix ends in a single vowel - Add the first letter of said suffix, then add the whole suffix
3. If the suffix ends in 2 or more consonants OR vowels - Drop the leftmost letter of the whole "2 or more consonants or vowels" sequence, then add the suffix

Suffixes that begin with a vowel:
1. If the suffix ends in a consonant - Add the suffix (no manipulation)
2. If the suffix ends in a single vowel - Drop the first letter, add the rest of the suffix
3. If the suffix ends in 2 or more consonants OR vowels - Add first letter of the suffix, then add the whole suffix
